## Straiv.io Tasks
# #1 Task (XML Handling)
The `executor.rb` file inside task_1 directory needs to be run, it have to sub directories, data to store xml files, and modules that do the actual labour of reading and converting xml to hash.

# #2 Task(Count array and sort)
The `count_array_and_sort.rb` file needs to be executed, this problem could be solved with multiple approches but since project is on ruby 2.7, i did it in same version while using short hands methods provided by this ruby version. Like `tally` method.
This solution is implemented with two approches.
