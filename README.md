## Straiv.io Tasks
# #1 Task (XML Handling)
The `executor.rb` file inside task_1 directory needs to be run, it have to sub directories, data to store xml files, and modules that do the actual labour of reading and converting xml to hash.

# #2 Task(Count array and sort)
The `count_array_and_sort.rb` file needs to be executed, this problem could be solved with multiple approches but since project is on ruby 2.7, i did it in same version while using short hands methods provided by this ruby version. Like `tally` method.
This solution is implemented with two approches.
# #3 Task(Handle Position)

# #4 Task(Base64 to Image)
This task is written in ruby file, The main directory of this tasks `task_4` contanins two directories and 1 ruby file. The  `modules` directory have required modules in it. The `root` directory have subdirectory `tmp` to store image file there as in this case we are assuming image is getting saved in Rails tmp directory. Since this is not written using Rails gem, this path is getting used, but in case of Rails you just need to write `Rails.root.join('tmp', 'image.png')`.

# #5 Task(Delete Duplicates)

# #6 Task(Create a duration)
This is convert a file from PDF to PDF/A1-b format. I am using gs(Ghost Script) here assuming it is already installed in machine.
PS: (I had to develop it on my friends linux machine as my mac wasnot allowing me to install GS)
